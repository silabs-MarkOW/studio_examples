# NCP

This is a Network  Co-Processor (NCP) target application. It runs the Bluetooth stack and provides access to it by exposing the Bluetooth API (BGAPI) via UART  connection. NCP mode makes it possible to run your application on a host  controller or PC.

This example does not have a GATT database, but makes it  possible to build one from the application using Dynamic GATT API. Use this example together with NCP host example applications.

> Note: this example expects a specific Gecko Bootloader to be present on your device. For details see the Troubleshooting section.

## Getting Started

To get started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth software and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth SDK v3.x Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

In the NCP context, the application runs on a host MCU or PC, which is called the NCP Host, while the Bluetooth stack runs on an EFR32, which is called the NCP Target.

The NCP Host and Target communicate via a serial interface (UART), which can be tunneled either via USB or via Ethernet if you use a development kit. The communication between the NCP Host and Target is defined in the Silicon Labs proprietary protocol called BGAPI. BGLib is the C reference implementation of the BGAPI protocol, which is to be used on the NCP Host side.

[AN1259: Using the v3.x Silicon Labs Bluetooth Stack in Network Co-Processor Mode](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1259-bt-ncp-mode-sdk-v3x.pdf) provides a detailed description how NCP works and how to configure it for your custom hardware.

The following figures show the system view of NCP mode.

## Evaluating with Bluetooth NCP Commander

NCP Commander can be used to control the target and test NCP firmware without developing your own host application. In Simplicity Studio, browse to the Launcher -> Compatible Tools tab and open NCP Commander. A shortcut to the Compatible Tools can also be found on the top toolbar. Follow these steps to make the NCP target advertise. See [AN1259: Using the Silicon Labs v3.x Bluetooth Stack in Network Co-Processor Mode](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1259-bt-ncp-mode-sdk-v3x.pdf) for additional details. 

1. Connect the board to a PC via USB and start NCP Commander from Simplicity Studio.

2. Choose the board from the list and click **Connect**.

3. The NCP host will try to get the Bluetooth address from the NCP target. If it succeeds, the connection is established.

4. Click **Create Set** and then **Start** under "Advertise Set (0)" table to start advertising. See the "Smart Console" for details.

5. Open the EFR Connect or any Bluetooth browser application to see your device advertising (without any name). You may also connect to the device, although it does not have a GATT database to be discovered by default.

## Extending the GATT database

This example project does not have a GATT database. It only contains the Generic Attributer Service. The GATT database can be built with the APIs provided by the Dynamic GATT Configurator component. See the Bluetooth API reference manual section "GATT Database" for more details.

## Troubleshooting

### Bootloader Issues

Note that Example Projects do not include a bootloader. However, Bluetooth-based Example Projects expect a bootloader to be present on the device in order to support device firmware upgrade (DFU). To get your application to work, you should either 
- flash the proper bootloader or
- remove the DFU functionality from the project.

**If you do not wish to add a bootloader**, then remove the DFU functionality by uninstalling the *Bootloader Application Interface* software component -- and all of its dependants. This will automatically put your application code to the start address of the flash, which means that a bootloader is no longer needed, but also that you will not be able to upgrade your firmware.

**If you want to add a bootloader**, then either 
- Create a bootloader project, build it and flash it to your device. Note that different projects expect different bootloaders:
  - for NCP and RCP projects create a *BGAPI UART DFU* type bootloader
  - for SoC projects on Series 1 devices create a *Bluetooth in-place OTA DFU* type bootloader or any *Internal Storage* type bootloader
  - for SoC projects on Series 2 devices create a *Bluetooth Apploader OTA DFU* type bootloader

- or run a precompiled Demo on your device from the Launcher view before flashing your application. Precompiled demos flash both bootloader and application images to the device. Flashing your own application image after the demo will overwrite the demo application but leave the bootloader in place. 
  - For NCP and RCP projects, flash the *Bluetooth - NCP* demo.
  - For SoC projects, flash the *Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer* demo.

**Important Notes:** 
- when you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.

- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.

- On Series 2 devices SoC example projects require a *Bluetooth Apploader OTA DFU* type bootloader by default. This bootloader needs a lot of flash space and does not fit into the regular bootloader area, hence the application start address must be shifted. This shift is automatically done by the *Apploader Support for Applications* software component, which is installed by default. If you want to use any other bootloader type, you should remove this software component in order to shift the application start address back to the end of the regular bootloader area. Note, that in this case you cannot do OTA DFU with Apploader, but you can still implement application-level OTA DFU by installing the *Application OTA DFU* software component instead of *In-place OTA DFU*.

For more information on bootloaders, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).


### Programming the Radio Board

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch is in the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
